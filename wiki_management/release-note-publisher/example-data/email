Subject: Updates to JASMIN Analysis Platform on %D

Dear JASMIN user,

This is to let you know that on %D,
the JASMIN Analysis Platform software on the JASMIN/CEMS machines
(jasmin-sci1, jasmin-sci2, cems-sci1) and LOTUS will be upgraded 
to version %V.

Release notes are as follows:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
%N---------------------------------------------------------------------

Users requiring earlier access to the updated software may log into 
jasmin-sci1-test.ceda.ac.uk, where it is already installed.  Please 
be aware that this test machine may be subject to later early upgrades
or other disruption without warning.

The packages are also already available on the JASMIN 'yum' repository, 
so managers of project virtual machines within JASMIN can update the
software with the command "yum update jasmin-sci-vm".  They are also
available on the yum repository at http://dist.ceda.ac.uk/yumrepo/ 
for installation on machines outside of JASMIN/CEMS (supported only on 
Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6).

Regards,

CEDA Team
